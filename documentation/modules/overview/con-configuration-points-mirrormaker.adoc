= Kafka MirrorMaker configuration

To set up MirrorMaker, a source and target (destination) Kafka cluster must be running.

You can use {ProductName} with MirrorMaker or MirrorMaker 2.0.

[discrete]
== MirrorMaker

MirrorMaker uses producers and consumers to replicate data across clusters.

MirrorMaker uses:

* Consumer configuration to consume data from the source cluster
* Producer configuration to output data to the target cluster

Consumer and producer configuration includes any authentication and encryption settings.

A _whitelist_ defines the topics to mirror from a source to a target cluster.

[discrete]
== MirrorMaker 2.0

MirrorMaker 2.0 is based on the Kafka Connect framework, _connectors_ managing the transfer of data between clusters.

MirrorMaker 2.0 uses:

* Source cluster configuration to consume data from the source cluster
* Target cluster configuration to output data to the target cluster

A MirrorMaker 2.0 `MirrorSourceConnector` custom resource replicates topics from a source cluster to a target cluster.

.Replication across two clusters
image::mirrormaker.png[MirrorMaker 2.0 replication]

The MirrorMaker 2.0 architecture supports bidirectional replication in an _active/active_ cluster configuration,
so both clusters are active and provide the same data simultaneously. A MirrorMaker 2.0 cluster is required at each target destination.
This is useful if you want to make the same data available locally in different geographical locations.

[discrete]
== Key Consumer configuration

Consumer group identifier:: The consumer group ID for a MirrorMaker consumer so that messages consumed are assigned to a consumer group.
Number of consumer streams:: A value to determine the number of consumers in a consumer group that consume a message in parallel.
Offset commit interval:: An offset commit interval to set the time between consuming and committing a message.

[discrete]
== Key Producer configuration

Cancel option for send failure:: You can define whether a message send failure is ignored or MirrorMaker is terminated and recreated.
